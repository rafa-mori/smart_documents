# smart_documents

**smart_documents** is a minimal Hyperledger Fabric smart contract (chaincode) for managing documents, signatures, and approvals.  
This repository is being published early for educational and preview purposes—development is ongoing, and more comprehensive documentation, examples, and integrations are on the way!

## What is this?

This project demonstrates a simple approach to document workflows on Hyperledger Fabric. It currently includes basic structures and contract logic for document signature and approval, designed to be modular and easy to extend. The codebase also features Bash scripts to help with building and cross-platform deployment.

**Note:**  
This is a partial, in-progress release. It’s intended to share ideas with the community and gather early feedback as development continues.  
Stay tuned for further updates, more contract types, and a complete usage guide.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete documentation for setup, deployment, and integration
- [ ] Publish examples and automation scripts for real-world usage
- [ ] Release additional smart contracts (2 more in the pipeline)
- [ ] Improve modularity and extend contract operations
- [ ] Collect feedback and refine based on community suggestions
